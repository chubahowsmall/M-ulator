# One entry per line
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored
#
# An entry begins with a set of numbers that describe the numbers
# for the type of chip/stack that should be available. The syntax
# is the same as when you print ranges of pages. Commas separate
# entries and dashes indicate ranges. The numbers must increase.
# No whitespace is allowed.
#
# e.g. if you specificed the following:
#
#   1,3-5,7,8,11-14 CTLv01
#
# If would result in a chip list of:
#
# CTLv01-1, CTLv01-3, CTLv01-4, CTLv01-5, CTLv01-7, CTLv01-8
# CTLv01-11, CTLv01-12, CTLv01-13, CTLv01-13, CTLv01-14

1,3 CTLv01
3-5 CTLv02
