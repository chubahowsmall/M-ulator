hex_0
    Has LC_MEM_REQ_OUT after the 1st cycle of READ operation. 
    LC_MEM_REQ_OUT remains for 2 cycles. Look for HADDR=0x0000_00aa. 
    The previous READ operation (from HADDR=0x0000_00a8) must be correctly handled after the LC_MEM access.
    This happens right at the start of ENUMERATION Tx.

    This code was originally built for PRCv12/PREv12.
    In PRCv13/PREv13, once it goes into sleep, it will NOT wake-up, due to the difference MMIO.
