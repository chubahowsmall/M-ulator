It becomes necessary for simulated devices to interact with the world. In the
case of simple peripherals (e.g. a UART) this is a simple connection between
the dedicated peripheral and an endpoint. For a bus archetype, however, this is
more complicated as up to Ns software and Nh hardware devices ought to be able
to communicate on one logically shared medium.

The ideas here are very preliminary, first attempts at fleshing out a hybrid
simulated/emulated bus system, but an ideal goal would be:

  * A common, simple bus interface that any type of actual bus driver could
  * connect to without an specialization in the platform code

  * Accurate representation of myriad hardware bus interfaces and the ability
  * to communicate emulated software with real hardware if available

Here goes nothing..
