A list of changes I'd like to make that are too late
for this project now:

 * The peripherals alignment should be clearer
     - LEDs still word aligned?
     - Poll UART stuff at addrs 4100, 4101, and 4102 instead

 * The CORE_..._read|write functions are inconsistanly named

 * Isolate functions to make their purposes clearer
     - operations/ Should only have access to read|write_byte|[half]word

 * Clearer naming scheme in general
     - operations --> ARM Core
     - core.c --> Memory Bus Interface
         + Move reset() out of core.c

 * Get rid of the "cpsr" nonsense - it doesn't even exist in
   the M profile anyways (cpsr === apsr in M profile); don't
   confuse people with your own larger agenda

 * simulator.o -> simulator.a
     - Clean up simulator code in general and refactor into
       multiple source files
